      <description>Introduction Welcome to my blog! I finally got around to actually writing something. Who knew it could be hard to find a decent theme. Anyway I am going to do my best at putting out two posts a month (maybe more) going over various tech related things I am doing. Some of them will come in the form of a series while others will be one offs. There are no garentees on the amount of conent in each post, some might just end up being code snippets for fixing bugs while others might be more in-depth.</description>
